# Smart Monochrome Dark Mode Extension

Smart Monochrome is a modern and minimal Chrome extension that forces a **clean black & white dark mode** on websites.  
It turns text white and backgrounds black while leaving images, videos, and icons untouched.  
The extension remembers your site preferences automatically.

## ✨ Features
- 🔄 Toggle dark mode per site
- 🎨 Simple black-and-white design (no color inversion)
- 🖼️ Images, logos, and icons stay in full color
- 💾 Saves your preference so it auto-applies next time
- 🖤 Minimal popup UI with black & white design
